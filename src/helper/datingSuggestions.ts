- Outdoor → parks, nature, open-air
- Cozy → indoor, calm environments
- Luxe → premium/luxury experiences
- Hidden Gems → less crowded, unique places

7. Timeline Rules:
- Must start exactly from the given Start Time
- Must be sequential and realistic
- Each step must include time (e.g., "10:00 AM - ...")
